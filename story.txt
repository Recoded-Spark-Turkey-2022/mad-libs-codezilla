I walk through the color jungle. I take out my beautiful[a] canteen. 
There's a colorful[a] parrot with a giant[a] worm[n] in his mouth right there in front of me in the enormous[a] trees! 
I gaze at his magnificient[a] wings[n]. A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream! 
A panther’s jumped[v] in front of my head! I hold[v] his terrifying[a]  breath. 
I remember I have a packet of chips[n]  that makes go into a deep slumber! 
I gave[v] it away from me in front of the desk[n].
Yes he's eating it! I flew[v] away through the scary[a] jungle. I meet my parents at the tent. 
Phew! It’s been an exciting day in the jungle
