I’VE BEEN DANCING[v] AT THE EDGE OF THE MOUNTINE[n] ,LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, NEVER REALLY KNOWING WHY I WISH I COULD BE THE CRAYZIEST[a] MAN[n] ,BUT I COME BACK TO THE MOUNTIN[n] ,NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY. EVERY DAY[n] I MAKE, EVERY ROAD LEADS BACK TO THE NOUN[n] I KNOW, WHERE I CAN NOT VERB[v] ,WHERE I LONG TO VERB[v] .SEE THE LINE WHERE THE NOUN[n] MEETS THE NOUN[n] ? IT VERB[v] ME AND NO ONE KNOWS, HOW FAR IT VERB[v] IF THE NOUN[n] IN MY NOUN[n] ON THE NOUN[n] STAYS BEHIND ME ONE DAY I’LL KNOW, IF I VERB[v] THERE’S JUST NO TELLING HOW FAR I’LL VERB[v] .
